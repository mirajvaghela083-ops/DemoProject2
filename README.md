## 📘 DemoProject2 — C# Logic Building & Practice

### 🚀 About This Repository

This repository contains my daily **C# (.NET) practice programs** focused on building strong **programming logic using loops, conditions, and basic algorithms**.
The goal of this project is to improve problem-solving skills .

### 🧠 What You’ll Find Here

This project includes console-based programs such as:

* ✅ HCF (Highest Common Factor) using Euclidean Algorithm
* ✅ LCM (Least Common Multiple) using formula method
* ✅ Prime Number Checker
* ✅ Fibonacci Series
* ✅ Factor Finder
* ✅ Pattern Printing
* ✅ Loop Practice (while, for)

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** C#
* **Framework:** .NET (Console Applications)
* **IDE:** Visual Studio
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

### ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
